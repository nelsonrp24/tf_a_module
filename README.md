# AAXIS Group Terraform Modules

The modules in this directory are meant to be referenced by terragrunt points of entry in the corresponding `tf_live` repo.

Any module with a README.md is generally meant to be a top level entry point, but the ones we're considering now are:

* backend-saas
* client-webapp
* admin
